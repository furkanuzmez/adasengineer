Sensors using millimeter waves have a longer detection distance compared with sensors using lasers, are all weather-resistant, and are characterized by superior motion prediction performance of preceding vehicles. Moreover, the antenna diameter is small with respect to the required angular resolution (antenna beam width), and it is excellent in mountability to vehicles.
